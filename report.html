<h2>Results</h2>
<p>
The SWISS-MODEL template library (SMTL version 2020-04-01, PDB release 2020-03-27) was searched with 
BLAST (<a href="#blastp">Camacho et al.</a>) and HHBlits (<a href="#hhblits">Remmert et al.</a>) 

 for evolutionary related structures matching the target sequence in Table T1. For details on the template search, see Materials and Methods. Overall 246 templates were found (Table T2).</p>

<h2>Materials and Methods</h2>



<h2>Template Search</h2>
<p>Template search with BLAST and HHBlits
 has been performed against the SWISS-MODEL template library (SMTL, last update: 2020-04-01, last included PDB release: 2020-03-27).</p>

<p>
The target sequence was searched with BLAST against the primary amino acid sequence contained in the SMTL.


A total of 124 templates were found.


</p> 


<p>
An initial HHblits profile has been built using the procedure outlined in (Remmert et al.), followed by 1 iteration of HHblits against NR20. The obtained profile has then be searched against all profiles of the SMTL. A total of 192 templates were found.</p>






<h2>Template Selection</h2>
<p>For each identified template, the template's quality has been predicted from features of the target-template alignment.
 The templates with the highest quality have then been selected for model building.</p>











<h2>Model Building</h2>
<p>
Models are built based on the target-template alignment using ProMod3. Coordinates which are conserved between the target and the template are copied from the template to the model. Insertions and deletions are remodelled using a fragment library. Side chains are then rebuilt. Finally, the geometry of the resulting model is regularized by using a force field. In case loop modelling with ProMod3 fails, an alternative model is built with PROMOD-II (<a href="#promodII">Guex et al.</a>).
</p>

<h2>Model Quality Estimation</h2>
<p>
The global and per-residue model quality has been assessed using the QMEAN scoring function (<a href="#qmean">Studer et al.</a>).
</p>

<h2>Ligand Modelling</h2>
<p>
Ligands present in the template structure are transferred by homology to the model when the following criteria are met: (a) The ligands are annotated as biologically relevant in the template library, (b) the ligand is in contact with the model, (c) the ligand is not clashing with the protein, (d) the residues in contact with the ligand are conserved between the target and the template. If any of these four criteria is not satisfied, a certain ligand will not be included in the model. The model summary includes information on why and which ligand has not been included.</p>

<h2>Oligomeric State Conservation</h2>
<p>
The quaternary structure annotation of the template is used to model the target sequence in its oligomeric form. The method (<a href="#qsqe">Bertoni et al.</a>) is based on a supervised machine learning algorithm, Support Vector Machines (SVM), which combines interface conservation, structural clustering, and other template features to provide a quaternary structure quality estimate (QSQE). The QSQE score is a number between 0 and 1, reflecting the expected accuracy of the interchain contacts for a model built based a given alignment and template. Higher numbers indicate higher reliability. This complements the GMQE score which estimates the accuracy of the tertiary structure of the resulting model.</p>
